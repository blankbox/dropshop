# DropShop

## Introduction

DropShop is an API first e-commerce platform for the dropshipping market. It is designed to work with SPA shop sites, or clients that use an API as the primary access point for:

## Drop-shipping

A dropshipping service handles Users (Dropshippers) that create bulk or trade orders whose fulfilment is handled by the service. A Dropshipper promotes a product for sale; they manage their own Customers, their Addresses and Orders etc. When sales are made, they place an Order for a product with a dropshipping service - who then picks, packs, and ships the order as specified.
